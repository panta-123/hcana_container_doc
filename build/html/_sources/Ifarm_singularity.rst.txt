******************************
Ifarm by default provides singularity/apptainer. Login to the the ifarm node and simply execute the command

.. code-block:: shell

    $ singularity --version

If you see the version name of songualrity/apptainer then it is working.

The default image is available in ifarm for hcana as singularity/apptainer. For now it is located in ``/group/hallc/panta/hcana-0.98.sif``.

To use the image you can simply run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ singularity shell --cleanenv  /group/hallc/panta/hcana-0.98.sif

your ``home`` directory is available automatically.

To make any directory to be available inside the container you can use ``--bind`` option. For example to acces group area in singularity.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ singularity shell --cleanenv --bins /group/hallc /group/hallc/panta/hcana-0.98.sif
